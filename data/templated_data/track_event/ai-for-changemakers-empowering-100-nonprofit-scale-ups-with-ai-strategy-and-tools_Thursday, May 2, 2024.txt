Event Description: Our vision at Tech To The Rescue is to make pro-bono work a new tech industry standard. We are getting there one impactful match at a time.  First of all, we want to inspire more intense tech & nonprofit collaboration - and we build on our experience from matching over 600 tech companies with verified non-profits for pro-bono projects!  Then, with "AI for Changemakers" - we want to launch an important invitation to tech companies (both SMEs and big tech): to engage in social impact projects led by 100 hand-picked nonprofits working in 5 impact areas from healthcare, climate change, disaster response, education to economic opportunity creation.Register here.
