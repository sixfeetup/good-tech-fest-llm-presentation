Our main base is in Varanasi, where it runs three educational projects. Varanasi is a city situated in Uttar Pradesh, which is one of four Indian states which the UN has declared to be poorer than the 40 poorest African countries added together.\n\nThe Yoga Mission does not simply provide children with literacy skills: we offer a stable, nurturing environment for children who, for many reasons, are in need. An alarming report by UNESCO recently concluded that 90% of Indian children are illiterate, even those who attend state-run schools. Girls are the most likely to miss out on an education, and our mission is to reverse this trend by employing a largely female staff in order to offer a safe and non-threatening learning environment to female pupils. This has the added benefit of providing jobs for local women (many of them former pupils themselves) so that they can support themselves, while being able to pay for their own further education.\n\nIn the city, by taking children off the streets and offering them stability and education, we show them the way out of the poverty trap, changing not only their lives, but all those around them. In this way we are improving the community one child at a time. In rural areas we aim to work from within the community for sustainable development based on ancient traditions, leading to conscious living, empowerment of women and education.\n\nReal education is about bringing the knowledge out from within.\n\nWe work with underprivileged children in rural and inner city areas, using educational methods rooted in ancient traditions for sustainable and conscious living.

His ability to think critically and lead inclusively are rare traits. He asks the deepest of questions and keeps his ego in check. Indy will gladly sweep the floor and lead the army all at the same time. He shows up for civic duty as a volunteer time and time again. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with him directly through WeDeepen. His podcast Political Hope is one of the top-listened to shows on the network. He enrolls the most interesting guests. Definitely listen to the show! ", "Richard Foster-Fletcher \ud83c\udf0e\n\n\n\nI had the very great pleasure of being interviewed by Indy for his podcast. I formed the impression that he is remarkable, acutely reflective and right on the button for what changes are needed in society and leadership. I enjoyed and valued our conversation greatly and plan to seek ways to collaborate and support his work.", "Ramon Govea\n\n\n\nAs a Commercial Producer & Director, I was casting a commercial for a client and really wanted to bring in some authentic positive energy for the Client's big moment, as we worked to define their brand.  So, I immediately thought of Indy who, despite his consummate professionalism, is very much an uplifting \"smiling Buddha\" archetype when he is working with a group. \n\nHe even brought his flute to set and we were able to capture some great impromptu moments before we wrapped for the day. He brought his A-game, was a very attentive listener, took direction well, and had no ego about the work.  Definitely a great team player and uplifting presence on set and in front of the camera!", "Marcela Denniston, CISSP\n\n\n\nIndy is an incredible teacher and thought leader who brings both intellect and imagination to every aspect of his work. His creative approaches to integrating science and spiritual knowledge into every aspect of his teaching makes learning with Indy not only easy and fun, but also refreshing. He takes concepts that would normally be mundane and very rigid, and applies innovative methods to keep his audience engaged and involved. Everyone has fun at Indy's classes! Indy can make even the most uptight person crack a smile! \n\nBut most importantly, you can truly see the passion and motivation behind everything Indy works on. I highly recommend Indy's courses and events to those seeking better integration and balance in life. ", "Manuri Ranasinghe\n\n\n\nIndy conducted workshops on laughing yoga and colaborated with sacred sound therapy to bring further healing to students at Soul Fitness LA, yoga studio and the community.  Students loved and saw results from Indy's ongoing workshops.  His work was much appreciated by the community and the students at Soul Fitness LA.", "Christian M.\n\n\n\nKnown Indy for many years and have worked with him a handful of times. Not only is he one of the most intelligent and driven individuals I've ever met, but he leads from a place of love and compassion. Every meeting we've had he makes it a point to give each person in the room an opportunity to share about themselves, including their passion for the project at hand, and what they're highest excitement is within the project, as well as the positive impact the project can have on the world around us. In addition to working together, I've attended a couple of his workshops and each time have left feeling elated and connected not only to the individuals around me but also to myself and my inner child, a relationship Indy helped me to reconnect with and deepen through his presence and dedication to helping others. To any company who is considering working with Indy you are in great hands and I have no doubts you will be moved by his brilliance and kindness. ", "Kandee Lewis\n\n\n\nMy company, The Positive Results Corporation engaged @Indy Rishi Singh to teach young ladies the joy of laughter.

The young ladies all enjoyed the time we spent with Indy Rishi! \n\nContinued success in all you adventures, and blessing of abundance!\n\nKandee", "Byron Grant\n\n\n\nGreat guy Indy Rishi!!
