With over 13 years of experience as a Salesforce Certified Developer and Consultant, I have established a Salesforce Foundation Alliance consulting practice that has gained national recognition and delivered impactful solutions for hundreds of nonprofits.\n\nI am also the founder and instructor of Digital Drivers Ed, an online community and course that turns digital voluntolds into functional CIOs for nonprofits with 5-15 staff. My mission is to empower them to confidently maintain data, manage systems, and drive digital culture, using human-centric, tech-savvy, and shame-free methods.
