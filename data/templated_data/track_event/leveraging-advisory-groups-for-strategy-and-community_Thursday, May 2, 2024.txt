Event Title: Leveraging Advisory Groups for Strategy and Community
Event Date: Thursday, May 2, 2024
Event Start Time: 11:00 AM
Event End Time: 11:30 AM
Event Description: DataKind has been leveraging an advisory group (DAG) of social impact organization leaders for the last 1.5 years to help inform our strategy and enable peer-to-peer learning. In this panel, Advisory Group member(s) will share how their participation in the group and collaboration with other members has helped with their own data-driven missions and social impact, and DataKind will share how we've learned and evolved our strategy through the group. We hope to facilitate an open discussion with session participants on the benefits of leveraging advisory groups such as the DAG for your nonprofit, different strategies for engaging communities and forming sector partnerships through Advisory Groups, and some lessons learned on how to make them successful.Register here!
