We can, and must, do better. Strive for that place where what seems impossible becomes real. Be the agent provocateur and hold the value of what uplifts all people, organizations, and our discourse. Re-center ourselves in what is right, what elevates us all and our communities, and not just what is profitable. Find equity over equality. Build to sustain and not simply win, and play the long game.
