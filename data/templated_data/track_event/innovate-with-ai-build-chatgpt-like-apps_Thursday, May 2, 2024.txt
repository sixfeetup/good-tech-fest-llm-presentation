Event Description: Join Calvin for an interactive workshop where organizations, both large and small, can unlock the potential of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create their own ChatGPT-like applications. Discover how to extract proprietary data insights, accelerate data-driven decision-making, boost productivity, and drive innovation across industries. What do you need to know before building your own app? Thereâ€™s a lot of code behind the OpenAI chat box. Calvin will review real-world examples and share best practices for how to:  - Master data gathering and extraction from multiple sources, including the challenging realm of PDFs. - Build an AI framework using Django and htmx, integrating powerful AI models from OpenAI, LangChain, and Llama Index. - Test the framework to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of responses. - Transform data into a format that AI "bots" can understand and learn from. As a bonus, all attendees will gain access to a GitHub repository packed with Python code (the 'lingua franca of AI') and ChatGPT-like app examples ready to be spun up on-site or remotely. Get ready to delve into the world of AI and transform your organization like never before!Register here!
