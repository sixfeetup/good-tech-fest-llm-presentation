Name: Adrien Ogee
Title: Cyber for good
Occupation: Chief Operations Officer at CyberPeace Institute
Bio: Hi! I'm Adrien, currently Chief Operating Officer at the CyberPeace Institute in Geneva, Switzerland. 

With a 15+ years career in cybersecurity, I'm a lifelong learner with academic credentials, including an MEng in Telecommunication, an MSc in Global Security and an MBA.

A leader-doer at heart, I thrive on solving complex challenges and venturing into new grounds. Throughout my journey, I've been a transformative force in cyber crisis response at both national and international levels. I’ve been leading teams in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, and won innovation awards for security programs we built. My proficiency in French, English, Spanish, and Portuguese has proven instrumental in these endeavours.

Driven by a deep passion for creating innovative solutions in cybersecurity, I find excitement in turning ideas into impactful programs to protect those who can't protect themselves. 

I’m always open to chat with new people and exchange perspectives on all-things cyber. And equally open to do sports or play games. 

Reach out!
