Police pre-arrest diversion or \u201cdeflection\u201d programs allow police departments to refer individuals to treatment, steering them away from traditional criminal justice system processing. This preliminary outcome evaluation examined A Way Out (AWO), a program in Lake County, Illinois, in which contact with police is initiated by individuals in the community who seek substance use disorder treatment. We examined groups of individuals referred to one residential treatment provider through AWO and through other means (criminal justice system, self, family, or healthcare/community providers). We examined group differences and compared the short-term (minimum of six months) post-treatment arrest outcomes of those groups. We found AWO participants were predominately White, male, aged in their late 20s to early 30s, and diagnosed with an opioid use disorder, which was similar to those referred to treatment in other ways. The groups showed no statistically significant differences in numbers of post-treatment misdemeanor, felony, or total arrests. Therefore, we found AWO is on par with other referral methods to treatment and can effectively direct community members to substance use disorder treatment and aid in their recovery.", "url": "https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/a-preliminary-outcome-evaluation-of-lake-county-illinois-police-referral-to-substance-use-disorder-treatment-program"}, {"name": "Policies and programs to address individuals who perpetrate intimate partner violence", "publisher": "Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority.", "published_on": {"day": 11, "month": 5, "year": 2021}, "description": "The criminal legal system has established policies and programs to address intimate partner violence, such as mandatory arrest policies, specialized courts, weapons bans, no drop prosecution, and orders of protection.
