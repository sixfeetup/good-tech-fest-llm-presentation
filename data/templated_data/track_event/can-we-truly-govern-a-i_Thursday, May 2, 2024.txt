Event Description: A.I. is all the rage and organizations are racing to jump on the A.I. train, some more prepared and equipped than others. But given much of the uncertainty and limitations of A.I., what responsibility do we have as a sector to make sure that the use of A.I. and its results are appropriate and meaningful and that those organizations that may not have the requisite capacities are informed and protected? Join Ajah's David Goodman as he talks to Project Evident's Kelly Fitzsimmons and BCT Partner's Peter York - two leading A.I. experts - about A.I. governance, what we can do, what we should do, and where to start.
