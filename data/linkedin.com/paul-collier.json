In my 8+ years working in nonprofits and consulting, I've worked with organizations ranging from food banks and family resource centers to social enterprise accelerators and mobile apps. \n\nI founded Coeffect so that I could help small and mid-size nonprofits get to the next level. Think of us as your outsourced Director of Learning & Evaluation. This means we help nonprofits and social enterprises put in place the fundamentals of program strategy, data collection, and data systems they need to grow. \n\nThe technical skills I bring to the table include: \n- Significant experience with data analysis tools including R, Tableau, Excel, and other reporting tools \n- Qualitative coding and quantitative statistical testing\n- Data system requirements design and assessment\n- Deep experience with Salesforce configuration, administration, third-party integrations, and reporting", "country": "US", "country_full_name": "United States of America", "city": "Denver", "state": "Colorado", "experiences": [{"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 9, "year": 2012}, "ends_at": null, "company": "Coeffect", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/coeffectco", "company_facebook_profile_url": null, "title": "Founder & Principal Consultant", "description": "I founded Coeffect because so many small and mid-sized nonprofits are held back by data. Funders invest in organizations that can show they catalyze positive change in their communities. While we're starting to see a positive shift in what kinds of information \"count\" in funding decisions, the reality is that systematically collected evidence of effectiveness still matters a great deal. Many smaller organizations don't have the time, knowledge, or skills on staff to do this work well.\n\nAs of mid-2020, Coeffect has helped 25+ organizations establish the fundamentals of their data practice. This includes building a Theory of Change that reflects the latest research and integrates thier community's lived experience. It also includes helping organizations create an intentional agenda for learning, identify metrics to monitor, and collect quantitative and qualitative data over time so they can continuously improve. \n\nAt Coeffect I work with a talented team of other consultants who complement my experience. In our work, we embrace technology. We've helped many of our clients establish effective Salesforce systems to hold information about and empower effective communication with their stakeholders. We are proficient in a range of data collection tools and the ways these tools connect with other systems. Finally, we've helped many organizations use data visualization tools like Tableau and Metabase to effectively communicate about their impact.   \n\nLearn more at our website: www.coeffect.co.", "location": "Greater Denver Area", "logo_url": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHLSVAaDddk5g/company-logo_100_100/0/1605208317772?e=1654732800&v=beta&t=8naYIpoiPiTPK1jIRJUdwAK0E3ql32gNXC46b0GRvjw"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 9, "year": 2014}, "ends_at": {"day": 31, "month": 8, "year": 2016}, "company": "San Francisco Child Abuse Prevention Center", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/safesoundkids", "company_facebook_profile_url": null, "title": "Data and Evaluation Manager", "description": "Served as Safe & Sound's internal evaluator for it's Family Resource Center.
