Event Title: Tech Equity Requires Governance Representation
Event Date: Thursday, May 2, 2024
Event Start Time: 12:30 PM
Event End Time: 2:00 PM
Event Description: The California Community Colleges enrolls approximately 2-million students that represent one of the most diverse populations in terms of demography, educational aspiration, geography, economic prosperity and opportunity. In this context, technology equity often focuses on students, namely their ethnic, racial and/or gender identities. Yet, less visible but likely as or more important in their experience with technology is governance. In this session, the presenter will describe the decentralized system of 116 colleges and how technology governance has been forced to evolve over time as part of the commitment to ensure postsecondary education and training are accessible to everyone in the state. The discussion will include attention to the value of intentional assessments of technology governance and describe how it is foundational to facilitate an equitable approach to technology access in what is made available, how, to whom, within which contexts, as decided by key stakeholders. Attendees will have an opportunity to engage in a hearty discusson about governance and what that means in the context of "good tech." Register here.
