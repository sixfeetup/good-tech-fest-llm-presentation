Bio: Kristi Mansfield is Founder and CEO of Seer Data & Analytics.    Seer Data is a scale up technology company turning data into action for people creating a better world. Seer Data’s library of Open data, AI-generated data sets, data sharing capabilities and Smart Insights allows people of all skillsets to use data for problem solving to benefit society. 

Every person has their own domain knowledge, expertise, and story. Few people have the skills and resources to fully harness the opportunity of the data age to take action to reshape and reform society.
We solve this problem by giving easy access to data to create knowledge for actions to change, reform and transform our communities.

Our users gain confidence to take the right actions, efficiency of knowing what’s working and what’s not and power to change the system.  We are serving more than 50 communities around Australia to act locally with data-driven decisions. Learn more at www.seerdata.ai
