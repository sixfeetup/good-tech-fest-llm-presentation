In 2020, UNDP international Evaluation Office (IEO) and ImpactMapper launched the methodology note for wider use and uptake. The GRES results taxonomy and index provides an important contribution to greater specificity in the gender lens philanthropy and investing conversation.\n\nThe aim of the GRES is to deepen a gender lens by providing operational definitions and marking distinctions between different types of results. Too often in gender equality work, people treat all results the same, but that is not the case. The GRES allows groups and evaluators to speak in more granularity about results; for example, is the result primarily focused on counting the number of men or women (gender targeted), or is it truly moving to shifting power and gendered social norms in communities or institutions (gender transformative)? These are two of the five GRES result categorizations. The GRES was published on UNDP IEO's site in 3 languages, English, French,and Spanish. This work strengthens gender lens investing and funding through metric development.\n\nThe GRES has had great uptake in UNDP and across diverse UN agencies and beyond in the evaluation community. More guidance with concrete examples from UN agencies is to come!
