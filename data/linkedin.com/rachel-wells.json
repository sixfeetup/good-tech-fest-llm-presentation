The automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that may be characterized by significant sub-national differences.

She joined the project after the initial scoping phase but quickly got up to speed on project details and deliverables. She worked closely with the three other DAs to prepare for an evening DataJam in February 2017 and weekend-long DataDive in March 2017. At both events, Rachel expertly navigated and communicated the technical requirements of the project to some 20 volunteers. In addition, she took it upon herself to cheer on and engage volunteers throughout the weekend. When it came time to present the final results to the Kiva USA program manager, Rachel was able to translate the complicated statistical analyses executed by volunteers into interpretable results for the partner. Rachel would most certainly be an asset to any team. I would highly recommend her!"], "activities": [{"title": "Community is everything when it comes to advancing innovation and social impact!
