Here, we examine aggregation principles and procedures for different mobile phone data streams and describe a common syntax for how aggregated data are used in research and policy. We argue that the principles of privacy and data protection are vital in assessing more technical aspects of aggregation and should be an important central feature to guide partnerships with governments who make use of research products.", "url": "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30193-X/fulltext"}, {"name": "Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 Policy Change in the Greater Seattle Area Using Mobility Data", "publisher": "Idmod.org", "published_on": {"day": 30, "month": 3, "year": 2020}, "description": "To stem the spread of COVID-19, Washington State instituted increasing levels of separation policies\nbetween March 11 and 24, 2020, including closing schools and prohibiting large groups.
