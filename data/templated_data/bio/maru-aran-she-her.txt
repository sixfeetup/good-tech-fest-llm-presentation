Title: Data Impacta | Data & AI for positive impact
Occupation: Co-Founder at Data Impacta
Bio: Hello there!üëã  Are you as passionate about data and applying technology for positive change as I am?

Let me tell you a little bit about myself: My journey has revolved around developing data analytics projects for a diverse range of companies over the past 10 years. However, it was during this time that I discovered the remarkable potential of data science for social good. It's a movement where data technology is harnessed to tackle pressing challenges, such as predictive modeling for healthcare facilities, environmental variables monitoring, classification models for transparency, and metrics monitoring for equity and diversity, among other impactful initiatives.

Now, at Data Impacta, we are dedicated to helping companies, non-profits, and social enterprises unlock the power of their data to amplify their positive impact on society and the environment.

If you share our vision of utilizing technology as a force for good, I invite you to reach out and connect. Together, let's collaborate and create a ripple effect of collective impact!

Looking forward to connecting and making a difference! üöÄüíªüåç
