Their ability to see the future, understand the complexity, and find a pathway to get through it all to realize the grand vision is inspiring and a priceless asset to any organization or company. Tracy came into Bonterra ready and ABLE to take us to the next level, and within a short time at the company, our teams were headed towards something pretty great because of them. \nTracy is your person if you want someone who can accelerate progress, challenge the status quo, and find the pathways to get to your BHAG. I'm fortunate to have met them, and I can't wait to see what comes next!", "Channing Kennedy\n\n\n\nI met Tracy at a very crucial turning point in my life \u2014 my first job in the nonprofit sector, in a new city, in a position where I was expected to have far more responsibility than the title indicated. If it weren't for Tracy, I absolutely think I would have disappeared within six months. But instead, that position became the first step in a life-changing career for me. Part of this is simply that Tracy is wonderfully supportive and honest, as a coworker and as a friend. But more than that is the lessons I learned from working with them and seeing how they work. Let me see if I can summarize them. \n\nTo be clear, they said absolutely none of this to me in so many words. But this is what stayed with me from our working relationship.\n\n\u2022 Don't get distracted by shiny things. (There are many different types of shiny things.) The purpose of your work is not things. It is people.\n\u2022 If you solve someone's problem, and they can't figure out how to use your solution, you have done the opposite of solving their problem.\n\u2022 Don't make guesses about how people do things. Go see. You'll be surprised.\n\u2022 Be loyal to your coworkers. Your coworkers are people.\n\u2022 Get your work done while you're at work.\n\u2022 Cultivate and maintain a hobby outside of work and keep it sacred.\n\u2022 Treat yourself like you matter. You are people.\n\nThese sound simple, but in practice, they contradict many of the messages I've gotten from the rest of the industry. Have I followed these guidelines at every step of my career? Absolutely not, and I've regretted it every time I've strayed. It's not easy! But it's worth the effort.\n\nI'll always be grateful that Tracy was there as a role model during this crucial time in my life. They are and will always be someone I turn to when I want to know what the real deal is, from someone who prioritizes people.
