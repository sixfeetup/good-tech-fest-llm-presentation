Event Date: Thursday, May 2, 2024
Event Start Time: 11:30 AM
Event End Time: 12:15 PM
Event Description: Have you ever tried building a form with complicated logic and found out it was impossible in Google Forms or other third party solutions? Ever gotten tired of figuring out how to export data and wished your form could connect to your database? Did you try looking up existing open source solutions and felt overwhelmed with how complicated some could be to configure? These were the problems that Wellfare was facing, a NYC-based nonprofit that distributes nutritious groceries to food insecure communities. Data Clinic, the data and tech for good arm of Two Sigma, partnered with Wellfare to build Data Gather, an open source data entry app builder that supports some of the most flexible configurations of any form-building tool. In this talk we will cover how Wellfare is using Data Gather to distribute food in NYC and explain the features that make Data Gather one of the most advanced data entry tools available, so you can build your own rich data entry flows that can fit right into your organizationâ€™s processes.
