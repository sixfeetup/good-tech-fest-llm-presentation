Event Description: We’re living through a period of increasingly intense and frequent crises, demanding more than ever from humanitarian and social impact organizations. Climate and conflict, food insecurity and migration, and backsliding on human rights. These often interconnected challenges loom too large for any one organization to solve. In this session, Dataminr’s VP of Social Good, Jessie End, will be joined by Direct Relief's VP of Research and Analysis, Andrew Shroeder, the United Nations Human Rights' Technology Advisor, George Hodge, the International Organization for Migration's Data Analyst, Andrea Garcia Borja, and Ushahidi's Executive Director, Angela Oduor Longati to explore how close and open collaboration between tech firms and social impact orgs can deliver scalable solutions to match the challenges of today. The conversation will focus on how organizations can leverage AI technologies and expertise to improve workflow efficiencies and enable more rapid and informed response and proactive policy decisions. We will also discuss the importance of principle-based innovation and partnerships, highlighting specific examples of this type of partnership in action. Register here.
