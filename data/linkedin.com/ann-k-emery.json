    "Juan Martin Romualdez\n\n\n\nI cannot overstate the value that Ann brought to our working group, as we were launching a pilot program which provided employment and career development services to individuals who were struggling to regain or maintain their stability in almost all areas of their lives.  Ann was very sensitive to the needs and challenges of our target population, but was absolutely committed to providing us with the most accurate data and overall \"picture\" of our program's strengths and weaknesses, as well as its most meaningful outcome measures.  She also demonstrated a unique ability to help everyone in the team recognize and realize that despite differences in perspectives and priorities, we were all striving toward the same goal.  I would encourage anyone who wanted a true evaluation of his or her program, to connect with Ann and discover how much she can help you understand what you are trying to do and what you are actually accomplishing.
