Second,\na subset of the data is analyzed to describe access to bachelor\u2019s degrees in engineering\nby PES using graduation rates. The findings show an increase in access to engineering\ndegree programs by disadvantaged students, but that access to engineering bachelor\u2019s\ndegrees may be constrained, and especially for underrepresented ethnic/racial groups.\nThe data highlight variable PES differences that accrue in engineering at entry and upon\ngraduation (6 years later) across ethnic/racial groups; these differences have implications\nfor broadening participation. Recommendations for future research and improving engineering\naccess at the secondary and postsecondary levels are discussed.", "url": "http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_higher_education/"}], "accomplishment_honors_awards": [], "accomplishment_patents": [], "accomplishment_courses": [], "accomplishment_projects": [], "accomplishment_test_scores": [], "volunteer_work": [], "certifications": [], "connections": 500, "people_also_viewed": [{"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjamestoscano", "name": "James Toscano, DLP", "summary": "President, Partners for College Affordability and Public Trust", "location": "Virginia Beach, VA"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-georgia-kouzoukas", "name": "Dr. Georgia Kouzoukas", "summary": "Senior Associate Director, Digital Engagement - Wharton External Affairs", "location": "Somers Point, NJ"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-hern%C3%A1ndez-b397211bb", "name": "Diana Hern\u00e1ndez", "summary": "--", "location": "Visalia, CA"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessejovel", "name": "Jesse Jovel", "summary": "Vice President, Corporate Work Study Program  at Verbum Dei High School", "location": "Los Angeles Metropolitan Area"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-davis-1aa95993", "name": "Spencer Davis", "summary": "--", "location": "United States"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lan-gao-30009811", "name": "Lan Gao", "summary": "Director of Institutional Research at Simmons University", "location": "Boston, MA"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugochi-jones", "name": "Ugochi Jones", "summary": "Director of Data Science", "location": "Greater Chicago Area"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dani-parker-moore-324026198", "name": "Dani Parker Moore", "summary": "Assistant Professor at Wake Forest University", "location": "Greensboro--Winston-Salem--High Point Area"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessa-martinez-penn-b62a231b6", "name": "Vanessa Martinez Penn", "summary": "Administrative Coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania", "location": "Takoma Park, MD"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-young-3b77861a", "name": "Jonathan Young", "summary": "Banking", "location": "Tampa, FL"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sosanya-jones-7ab62578", "name": "Sosanya Jones", "summary": "Associate Professor at Howard University", "location": "Washington, DC"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/careernexus", "name": "Kurt Madden", "summary": "Chief Executive Officer at CareerNexus", "location": "Fresno, CA"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-rodriguez-647201108", "name": "Elizabeth Rodriguez", "summary": "Student, Master of Science in Counseling Student Affairs & College Counseling", "location": "Fresno, CA"}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenaaweber", "name": "Lorena A.
