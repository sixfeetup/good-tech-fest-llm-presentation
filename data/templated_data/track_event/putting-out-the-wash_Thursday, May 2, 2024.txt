Event Description: It's not just greenwashing. Purpose-washing- a gap between your say you value and what you do- is becoming a massive reputational risk. It can happen unintentionally because of communication misalignments or organization structure. If you know your industry expectations and your organization's sources of tension, you can put out the wash with a brand strategy that aligns your stakeholders on your mission and action towards it. This session will walk you through what washing looks like from different industry perspectives, its universal causes, and the tools to mitigate the risk.Register here.
