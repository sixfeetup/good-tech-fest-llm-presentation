Event Description: When a child steps into the volatile world of the foster care system in the US, they are thrust into an emotional rollercoaster, passed through an average of 7 different foster homes. Imagine being a child adjusting to 7 different sets of house rules, 7 different beds, and trying to build a relationship with 7 different strangers who you are told are your guardians. The heart-wrenching trauma of being taken away from one's family and thrust into the arms of numerous strangers lays the foundation for devastating outcomes for foster children. This trauma often leads to homelessness, incarceration and even suicide.  In 2021, Miracle Foundation launched a pilot of our first software offering that seeked to reduce child movement within the foster system. Present day, we have two products in production, being used by organizations in three countries, on three different continents. In this session we will discuss why our non-profit decided to get into the software business, how we are operating it, what we have learned, and what we would like to accomplish in the future. If your organization is considering building software to scale impact, this session is for you!Register here.
