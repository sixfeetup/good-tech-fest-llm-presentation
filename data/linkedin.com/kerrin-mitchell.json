I have known Kerrin for five years and managed her directly for much of this time.  During this time Kerrin took on highly complex challenges which required a great deal of creativity, organization, leadership and maturity.  These challenges generally consisted of very high profile activities with significant impact to the business including creating revenue recognition processes, managing a sales crediting team, leading large portions of the fiscal year sales setup process and running the PMO of a multi-million dollar sales finance operations porfolio.  Kerrin has a great deal of positive energy and is a natural people person which allows for strong relationships and great collaboration.  After I left my role in Sales Finance Ops, Kerrin continued to run the PMO directly under the VP, Sales Ops for quite some time with consistent positive results.  Kerrin is currently leading the Cisco finance organization in Web 2.0 collaboration tools which has required tenacity, creativity, passion and excellent communition skills at multiple levels of the organization.  I have enjoyed watching Kerrin's strong career progression and expect to continue to see great things from her in the future.", "Toni Knudson\n\n\n\nKerrin drove the creation and implementation of an innovative Enterprise Web 2.0 portal to improve collaboration across  2500+ world-wide finance users.
