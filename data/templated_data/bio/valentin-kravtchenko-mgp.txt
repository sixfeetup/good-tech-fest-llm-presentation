Name: Valentin Kravtchenko, MGP
Title: CEO @ Grey-Box.ca // New Founders to Watch 2022 & Researcher in Bioethics (Public Health School)
Occupation: Chief Executive Officer at Grey-box - social innovation
Bio: Valentin Kravtchenko has 7 years of experience in project management and over a decade in communication - with a focus on new media, new technologies, and social entrepreneurship. 

He founded Grey-Box.ca, a social innovation startup that provides free WiFi access to educational resources in remote areas where access to the Internet and electricity is inconsistent (50% of the world's population is disconnected according to the UN Broadband Commission).

He specializes in the management of projects that involve creative and technical components. He trains and supports clients in their content creation strategies for the digital age. 

He also masters the occult art of "growth hacking" but chooses to use it for good. In his free time, Valentin is involved in community organizations such as Montreal Newtech all the while acting as a stealth paladin (chaotic neutral).

Valentin was named Person of the Year by Times Magazine in 2006 (and so were you)
