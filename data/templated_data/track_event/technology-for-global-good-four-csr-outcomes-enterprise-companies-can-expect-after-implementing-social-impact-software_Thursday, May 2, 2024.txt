What are they doing differently? How can other modern companies, as well as legacy brands looking to modernize their approach to corporate social responsibility, learn from Kyndryls approach? In this discussion, Kyndryl’s Monoswita Saha joins Deed’s Stav Kashi to think about the four cornerstones of responsible business: 1) Prioritizing social impact; 2) Leading on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) in advance of U.S. and E.U. regulations; 3) Authentic, tangible approach to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) 4) Employee engagement in workplace giving and volunteering After providing a unique case study in the form of Kyndryl’s own programs, this session will include a lively Q&A to engage social impact professionals in creative problem-solving.Here is the direct registration link for the session if you want to share it out.
