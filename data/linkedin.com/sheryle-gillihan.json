She serves as a social enterprise advisor, a keynote speaker, a mentor, and a catalyst for positive impact.  She sits on several boards to include current roles with TCCD\u2019s Business School Advisory Board and EO Fort Worth\u2019s board.\n\nSheryle fuses her hope for a better, brighter future with over 15 years of leadership, operations, and technical management experience. Ranging from military to corporate to nonprofit sectors, her career path led her to CauseLabs in 2010, where she brought immense perspective and coordination for delivering web services for positive impact.\n\n\"I have a varied background of education, skills, and experience. My values undergird all that I do and the decisions that I make. Many of my values were impressed upon me as a military daughter, then a soldier myself, and then, a military spouse. The rest are derived from my faith, my family, and my connection with nature.\n \nMy passion for outreach led me away from corporate America to CauseLabs, a socially conscious web strategy, design, and dev agency using technology to drive meaningful and sustainable impact.\n\nI love making a difference with my day to day work, and sometimes I get to witness my work in the field, which can be in the most impoverished areas of the globe. CauseLabs blends my love of problem-solving with my passion for the causes I support: equality, education, freedom, and giving voice to those who either don't have one or who feel inferior or invisible.\n\nIn my free time... Ha! We own a business, there's no 'free' time! I try to keep in touch with friends (thanks social media) but spend most of my time enjoying our ranch, tending chickens, and soon other livestock.

I also love speaking and mentorship.\"\n\nPersonality Test Results: ENFJ - 4583 - 7 wing 6 - Words of Affirmation - High D, High I, Low S, Lower C - Power/Prestige - Empathetic Idealist, Social Butterfly, Gleeful Rebellion, Shared Vision, Mostly Sunny, Confident Drive, Grand Plans, Focused Ambition, and Open Arms.

I spent a day picking her brain on the possibilities and use cases for my business. I was blown away with the depth of her knowledge and her creativity. I feel that with Gen AI we have been given many tools. But we have only scratched the surface of what's possible. It's experts like Sheryle who will show mere mortals like me to harness its potential.", "Sarah Rannals\n\n\n\nSheryle s a perfect example of an active and helpful mentor! Thanks to her guidance, I gained a lot of knowledge about navigating work/life balance, company culture-to-self misalignment, and how to bring my whole self to work! She has incredible expertise to share with women (and all) in many aspects both personal and professional. I was lucky enough to work with her at CauseLabs in various roles, and even luckier to continue a mentorship with her following my time with the company. Every step of the way learning by her example. I was made a better Project Manager, a wiser Marketing Manager, and a more well-round employee as a whole from the invaluable lessons learned with her guidance! Highly recommend Sheryle for her expertise in mentorship!"], "activities": [], "similarly_named_profiles": [], "articles": [], "groups": [{"profile_pic_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5607AQGrXGJzQCmi8A/group-logo_image-shrink_400x400/0/1701091600171?e=1710313200&v=beta&t=D804ezE0ciSBiyod3nxnegGJZYFCAn-RqpXHpODZ82g", "name": "The AI Lab 2.0 - Jumpstart January 2024", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14353038"}, {"profile_pic_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E07AQEryTCYGlXIEw/group-logo_image-shrink_48x48/0/1686174683509?e=1710313200&v=beta&t=oGvirMt5WsJfW1r0IxZAbsax7q7Wt-4kCMFFtqGqBgo", "name": "The AI Lab - Jumpstart July 2023", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12851208"}], "skills": [], "inferred_salary": null, "gender": null, "birth_date": null, "industry": null, "extra": null, "interests": [], "personal_emails": [], "personal_numbers": []}
