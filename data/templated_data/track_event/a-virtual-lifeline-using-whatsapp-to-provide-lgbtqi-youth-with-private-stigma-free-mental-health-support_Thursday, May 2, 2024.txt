Event Title: A virtual lifeline: using WhatsApp to provide LGBTQI+ youth with private, stigma-free mental health support
Event Date: Thursday, May 2, 2024
Event Start Time: 3:00 PM
Event End Time: 3:30 PM
Event Description: Across the world, young people are dealing with mental health challenges at increasing rates. The situation is especially bad, however, for LGBTQI+ communities in the Global South. Not only do LGBTQI+ youth suffer from mental health challenges at much higher rates than their peers, but they also risk stigma and discrimination accessing the scarce mental health services that do exist. SameSame is a tech non-profit that is seeking to overcome these challenges and support LGBTQI+ youth to achieve their potential in extraordinary circumstances by identifying evidence-based mental health interventions, adapting them for delivery via scalable and safe digital channels and using data to create ever-more personalized and effective treatments. In this session, the SameSame team will share the journey they've been on, from ideation to launch, making the case that more needs to be done to carve out dedicated, safe digital and online spaces for queer youth.Register here.
